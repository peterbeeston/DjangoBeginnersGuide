Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the email address {{ email }}.
Follow the link below:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

In case you forgot your Django Boards username: {{ user.username }}

If clicking the above link doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL
into a new browser window instead.

If tou've received this email in error, it's likely that another user entered
your email address by mistake whilst trying to reset their password. If you didn't
initiate the request, you don't need to take any futher action and can safely
disregard this email.

Thanks,

The Django Boards Team
